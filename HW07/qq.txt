Number of solutions do not include transformations.

2x2: 0
No matter where you put the first queen, there is no legal space for the second
queen.

3x3: 0
The first and second queens can be placed a knight's move away from each other,
but there is no legal space for the third queen afterwards.

4x4: 1
The 4 queens are all a knight's move away from each other.

5x5: 2
The 4x4 case can be augmented by adding a queen in the corner. 

6x6: 1
There is only 1 6x6 case, where 3 queens on half the board are a knight's move
away from each other, and the other 3 queens on the other half are also a
knight's move away from each other. This case can be rotated, but there is
only 1 unique case.

7x7: >2
Can be done augmenting 6x6 with a corner queen. Can also be solved in another way.

8x8: >2
Should be more than the number for 7x7, because as the board gets bigger, there should be more solutions.
