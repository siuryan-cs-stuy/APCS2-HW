Similar to the algorithm for the n-queens problem...

Starting in the top left corner:
1. Move the knight to the 1) highest and 2) furthest right legal move legal move possible
2. If there is another legal move, go to 1.
3. If there are no legal moves and all the spaces have been touched, a solution has been found.
4. Otherwise, rewind moves until you can make a legal move that has not been made before, and go to 1.
